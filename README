To compile execute make, two executable should be created fnc-fork and fnc-thread

Example of executing a test:
./fnc-fork -c 10000 -l 1000000000 -3 PMER_ME_DATA_CACHE_DTIM_BUSY

A list of all the events that can be passed to the argument -3 can be obtained with the following command:
awk '/define PMER_/{print $2}' multi.c
